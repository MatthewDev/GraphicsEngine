DuckHunt
=============
DuckHunt is a simple game where you click to bring down a duck. This was created in 40 minutes, so it isn't the neatest code.

GraphicsEngine
==============

GraphicsEngine is a very simple and barebones graphic engine for C# Winforms projects. It's designed to have only the necessary components, including sprite wrapper support and multi-threaded control over each frame.

You can easily modify parts of the code to make GraphicsEngine run the way you want. The code is mostly easy to read and understand. Unfortunately, Winform's transparency implementation is a bit sketchy, so you might need to plan accordingly.

Prerequisites: Visual Studio 2012 and up FOR DESKTOP

Sample Projects
==============
A bit lost, or maybe just bored? You can take a look at the several sample projects made using this platform by me, by browsing the branches of this repo!
